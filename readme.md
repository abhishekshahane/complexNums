# complexNums
<h3>A C++ script to add complex numbers.</h3>
<h5>Enter your complex numbers like so: [Real Number] + [Complex number]</h5>
<h4>For example:</h4>
<h5>3 + 4i</h5>
<h5>My inspiration for making this was when I noticed Go and Python had this feature, so why not add it to C++?</h5>
</h4>Enjoy!<h4>
