# complexNums
<h3>A C++ script to add complex numbers.</h3>
<h5>Enter your complex numbers like so: [Real Number] + [Complex number]</h5>
<h4>For example:</h4>
<h5>3 + 4i</h5>
<ul>Warning: </ul>
<li>All complex numbers need to be in the form a + bi, as per the definition. The complex numbers need to be simplified to two variables, and cannot involve division(for example: 3*4i + 3/25i is not a valid expression</li>
<li>This should work for most(if not all) equations, I've tested it several times. </li>
<h4>How to use: </h4>
First, run `g++ -o main main.cpp header.cpp` and then `main`(remember to change the path to your own in the makefile).

<h5>My inspiration for making this was when I noticed Go and Python had this feature, so why not add it to C++?</h5>
</h4>Enjoy!<h4>
